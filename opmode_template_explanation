@TeleOp: This annotation indicates that the class is a TeleOp (Teleoperated) mode. In FTC, TeleOp is when drivers control the robot using game controllers.
The comment block at the top is a simple header indicating that this is a base OpMode template.



public class MyFIRSTJavaOpMode extends LinearOpMode {
MyFIRSTJavaOpMode: This is the name of the class, and it extends LinearOpMode, which is a base class for OpModes that allows for sequential execution of code.
Member Variables


private Gyroscope imu;
private DcMotor motorTest;
private DigitalChannel digitalTouch;
private DistanceSensor sensorColorRange;
private Servo servoTest;
These are instance variables that define hardware components that the robot will use:
imu: A gyroscope sensor for orientation and movement data.
motorTest: A DC motor that can be controlled to move parts of the robot.
digitalTouch: A digital touch sensor, often used to detect whether something is pressed or not.
sensorColorRange: A distance sensor that can also detect color, useful for line following or object detection.
servoTest: A servo motor for precise positioning.


@Override
public void runOpMode() {
This is the main method that will be called when the OpMode starts. It contains the initialization and main loop for the robot's operation.
Initialization


imu = hardwareMap.get(Gyroscope.class, "imu");
motorTest = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "motorTest");
digitalTouch = hardwareMap.get(DigitalChannel.class, "digitalTouch");
sensorColorRange = hardwareMap.get(DistanceSensor.class, "sensorColorRange");
servoTest = hardwareMap.get(Servo.class, "servoTest");
The hardware components are initialized by retrieving them from the hardwareMap, which contains the robot’s hardware configuration as defined in the FTC app.
Telemetry


telemetry.addData("Status", "Initialized");
telemetry.update();
This updates the driver station's telemetry to display that the robot has been initialized.



Waiting for Start
waitForStart();
This method halts execution until the driver presses the play button on the driver station, indicating that the match has started.



while (opModeIsActive()) {
    telemetry.addData("Status", "Running");
    telemetry.update();
}
This loop runs as long as the OpMode is active. Inside the loop, it updates the telemetry to indicate that the robot is currently running. You can add more functionality here, such as controlling motors or reading sensor values.
Summary
This code sets up a basic structure for a TeleOp mode in an FTC robot. It initializes several hardware components, waits for the start of the match, and enters a loop that continues until the match ends. You would typically add additional logic within the main loop to control the robot’s behavior based on sensor input and driver commands.
