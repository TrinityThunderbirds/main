/*

 * DRIVING STYLE: The drive on this robot is controlled in an "Arcade" style, with the left stick Y axis
 * controlling the forward movement and the right stick X axis controlling rotation.
 * This allows easy transition to a standard "First Person" control of a
 * mecanum or omnidirectional chassis.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Make super sure that the arm is reset into the robot, and the wrist is folded in before
 * you run start the OpMode. The motor's encoder is "relative" and will move the number of degrees
 * you request it to based on the starting position. So if it starts too high, all the motor
 * setpoints will be wrong.
 *
 * MOST IMPORTANT
 * SO IMPORTANT
 * MUY IMPORTANT
 * VVVVVVVVVVVVV
 *
 * CONTROLS:
 * Left Joystick: Forward + Back MOTORS
 * Right Joystick: Rotation MOTORS
 * A: INTAKE collect
 * X: INTAKE off
 * B: INTAKE deposit
 * RB: Intake sample ARM pos.
 * LB: Pos. of ARM to clear barier
 * Y: Low basket ARM pos.
 * DpadLeft: WRIST folded, starting wrist pos.
 * DpadRight: Specimin High Chamber WRIST Pos.
 * DpadUp: ARM pos. to move to hook to hang.
 * DpadDown: ARM moves to hang.

            Encoders report when the motor has moved a specified angle. They send out pulses which
            only occur at specific intervals (see our ARM_TICKS_PER_DEGREE). This means that the
            position our arm is currently at can be expressed as a whole number of encoder "ticks".
            The encoder will never report a partial number of ticks. So we can store the position in
            an integer (or int).
            A lot of the variables we use in FTC are doubles. These can capture fractions of whole
            numbers. Which is great when we want our arm to move to 122.5Â°, or we want to set our
            servo power to 0.5.

            setTargetPosition is expecting a number of encoder ticks to drive to. Since encoder
            ticks are always whole numbers, it expects an int. But we want to think about our
            arm position in degrees. And we'd like to be able to set it to fractions of a degree.
            So we make our arm positions Doubles. This allows us to precisely multiply together
            armPosition and our armPositionFudgeFactor. But once we're done multiplying these
            variables. We can decide which exact encoder tick we want our motor to go to. We do
            this by "typecasting" our double, into an int. This takes our fractional double and
            rounds it to the nearest whole number.
